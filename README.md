# Learning Documents
###### _by: Alfred Reyes_

My name is John Alfred Reyes, I'm a Software Engineer with experience working with both local and international clients. I specialize in Fullstack Development. Primarily I use JS stack technologies such as React and Express.js. I'm also a enthusiast of the cloud. I built this repo with the intention of showcasing my highlevel understanding of my domain knowledge which is Javascript.


I will push my new learnings in this repo as much as I could. I'm also planning to include tech/topics that are not JS related in the future. I learn along the way so feel free to criticize my work here, that would be highly appreciated. Have fun learning!
